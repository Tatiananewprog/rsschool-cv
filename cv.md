### Briefly about myself:

I began my career path as a lecturer in the Advertising department at the Siberian University of Consumer Cooperation. My professional occupation has been connected to creating advertisements. So from 2007 to 2014, I have been working in education. After that, I decided to change my line of work to a more practical one. 


During 2014-2016, I worked as a marketing specialist in several companies. I was responsible for different aspects of marketing: distribution of goods (Siberian Food Company), marketing research (Spice World), product marketing (Dental Servis), content marketing and SEO (Relsib). 


In 2016, my hobby of 3D printing turned into a standalone project.


Remote work as a self-employed 3D printer gave me a chance to learn Frontend Development. Iâ€™m interested in this area and, at least, want to make a website for my store. I hope that this area will open up great opportunities for professional self-realization. Being one of these Rolling Scopes development communities means keeping moving forward.


I hope my receptivity to change and ability to learn tirelessly help me along my professional path.
